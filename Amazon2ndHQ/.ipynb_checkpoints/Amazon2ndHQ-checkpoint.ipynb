    "# Impact of Neighborhood on Amazon HQ2 selection\n",

    "###   *Will good neighborhood attract new business office for Unicorn companies*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon announced the process to look for the 2nd headquarter in 2017, it led to a hot wave of biding on this proposal from 54 states, provinces, districts, and territories due to the huge financial and job potentials. 200 cities entered the final list. Among the 20 cities in the final lists, Long Island, New York and Crystal city, Virginia were selected as the locations for 2nd headquarters in Nov, 2018. Due to objection from various political parties, Amazon has canceled the selection Long Island NY in early 2019 while the development at Crystal city VA is still undergoing.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Amazon has laid down the requirement for the 2HQ selection, such as Metropolitan areas with certain populations, close to popular center and highway/airport, availability of talents, financial incentives etc,  it will be interesting to check if the neighborhood of candidate locations/cities is an important criteria.  For example, does the 2HQ have similar neighborhood as that in current HQ in Seattle, WA? If the neighborhood similarity  plays significant role in 2HQ selection, it will provide enough information for cities/territories authorities to set a strategic approach to attract new businesses in future. \n",

    "## Methodology\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The neighborhood info or list for three cities, Seattle WA, Arlington VA and Queens, NY can be obtained from open data source or Wiki website. Then the latitude and longitude information for each neighborhood ca been obtained using geopy package. After consolidation of all datasets, the top 100 popular venues from each neighborhood can be retrieved usign Four Square API. Then K-cluster algorithm will be used to cluster all neighborhood. Finally the similarity of neighborhood from each cities will be compared to check how much of similar neighborhood from 3 cities. This will lead to conclusion regarding the impact of neighborhood similarity on Amazon 2HQ selection.\n",
